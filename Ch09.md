# Chpater 9: Graph Algorithms

## 9.1 Definitions

A _path_ is a sequence of vertices. The number of vertices can be 1.

A _simple path_ is a path such that all vertices are distanct, except the first and the last.

e.g:

* {a} is a simple path of length 0
* {a, b, a} is a simple path of length 2
* {a, b, c, a, m} isn't a simple path.

A _cycle is a path

* of length at least 1
* w1 = wn

e.g:

* {a} isn't a cycle
* {a, a} is cycle

The cycle is _simple_ if the path is simple

*Note: for undirected graph, the edges must be distinct.*

### 9.1.1 Representation

1. *Adjacency Matrix*

   This uses a two dimensional array. The space requirement is O(V^2). (Note for any graph, there CAN BE V^2 edges)

   Note:

   An adjacency matrix is an appropriate represention if the graph is _dense_: E = O(V^2)

   The graph is dense or not usually depends on the degree of each vertex

2. *Adjscency List*

   This should be used if the graph is sparse.

   The space requirement is O(E + V). This is because **we need exactly one node for a vertex or an edge.**

   Please recall the structure used to represent this:

   * A array of header cells represent all vertices

   * Each header cell starts a list of vertices adjacent from it.

   In real-life applications, the vertices have names that's unknown at compile time. *So we need a hash table and hash function to provide a mapping of names to numbers 1 to V.*

   Also in output, we need the name of these vertices. So we may keep an array of pointers **into the hash table**.

## 9.2 Topological Sort

A topological sort is an ordering of vertices **in a directed acyclic graph**.

A simple algorithm:

1. Find any vertex **with no incoming edges**. Remove it **along with its edges**.

2. Repeat 1 until no vertices are left.

To formalize this, we need to define the indegree of a vertex.

**Note**: the removal of vertices and edges are performed via decrement of indegree, not real vertex or edges.

Now we define a function topsort:

* Function: void topsort(G)

* Precondition: 
  
  Any graph G with an indegree array

* Postcondition:

  Ordering information is stored with each vertices.

* Pseudocode

    void topsort(Graph G)
    {
    	unsigned int counter;
    	vertex v, w;

    	for (counter = 0; counter < NUM_VERTEX; counter++)
    	{
    		// Return NOT_A_VERTEX if no such vertex exists.
    		v = find_new_vertex_of_indegree_zero;
    		if (v == NOT_A_VERTEX)
    		{
    			error("Graph has a cycle");
    		}
    		top_num[v] = counter;
    		for each w adjacent to v
    			indegree[w]--;
    	}
    }

**Note**: every v or w is just a integer.

**Analysis:**

Each find_new_vertex_of_indegree_zero scan the indegree array, each of which takes O(V). So the running time of this algorithm is O(V^2).

**Optimization:**

* Define a stack or a queue
* At any time, vertices of indegree 0 is push into this box
* Every time we update the ordering, we
  * Delete this vertex from the box
  * Change indegree of all adjacent vertices
  * Check if new vertices should be added.
* Stop if the box is empty

Pseudocode:

    void topsort(Graph G)
    {
    	Queue Q;
    	unsigned int counter;
    	vertex v, w;

    	Q = CreateQueue(NUM_VERTEX);
    	counter = 0;
    	// Initialize the "box"
    	for each vertex v
    	{
    		if (indegree[v] == 0)
    			enqueue(Q, v);
    	}
    	while(!is_empty(Q))
    	{
    		v = dequeue(Q);
    		top_num[v] = count++;
    		for each w adjacent to v
    		{
    			if(--indegree[w] == 0)
    				enqueue(Q, w);
    		}
    	}
    }

The time to perform this algorithm is O(E + V) because

* We start with scanning thought all vertex
* We scan each adjacent vertices AND find all that of indegree 0, instead of scanning the entire array.

## Shotest-Path Algorithm

_Weighted path length_ is defined as the sum of weight of all edges in the path.

**Single-Source Shortes Path Problem:**

_Given as input a weighted graph G = (V, E), and a vertex s, find the shortest weighted path from s to every other vertex in G._

_Negative-cost cycle_

In a graph with edges of negetive weight, there may be a infinite long cycle that leads to infinitely small path weight.

In many practical applications, we might want to find the shortest path from one vertex, s, to only one other vertex, t. **Currently there are no algorithms in which finding the path from s to one vertex is any faster than finding the path from s to all vertices.**

### 9.3.1 Unweighted Shortest Paths

In unweighted graph, we only care about the number of edges in a path.

**Breadth-First Search**

*Ideas
  * Layer: a group of vertices
  * We keep updating shortest-path length one layer at a time
*Algorithm
  1. Put s in layer[0];
  2. Mark all length layer[i] with i
  3. Put all vertices adjacent to vertices in layer[i] in layer[i + 1]
  4. Go to 2 if there are vertices left.

This is similar to a level-order traversal for trees.

For each vertex, we will keep track of three pieces of information:

* d<sub>v</sub>: distance from s.
* p<sub>v</sub>: keeping path.
* known: mark whether processed.

We use a type _Table_ to keep track of these information.

Pseudocode

This pseudocode doesn't assume any vertex is explicitly specified. All information it has is a **initialized table** containing d<sub>v</sub>, p<sub>v</sub> and known.

    void unweighted(Table T)
    {
	    unsigned int curr_dist:
		vertex v, w;

		// Curr_dist marks the current layer. But we need to traverse all vertices to determine which vertices are included
		for (curr_dist = 0; curr_dist < NUM_VERTEX; curr_dist++)
		{
			for each vertex v
			{
				if (!T[v].knonw && T[v].dist == curr_dist)
				{
					T[v].known = TRUE;
					for each w adjacent to v
					{
						if (T[w].dist == INT_MAX)
						{
							T[w].dist = curr_dist + 1;
							T[w].path = v;
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

This algorithm actually do the following things:

* Set current layer to 0
* Scanning all vertices to find vertices at layer [i]
* Set distance of all adjacent vertices
* Update i

This takes a running time of O(V^2) because

* We assume there all |V| layers
* In each layer we scan all |V| vertices.

This inefficiency can be removed by **keeping two boxes.** One keeps current layer and the other next layer.

Or even further, **using only one queue.** The current layer is always being dequeued and the next enqueued.

In the refined algorithm, we assume s is known somehow.

An INT_MAX is used to indicate vertex not processed.

Pseudocode:

	void unweighted(Table T)
	{
		Queue Q
		vertex v, w;

		Q = create_queue(NUM_VERTEX);
		enqueue s;

		while (!is_empty(Q))
		{
			v = dequeue(Q);
			for each w adjacent to v
			{
				if (T[w].dist = INT_MAX)
				{
					T[w].dist = T[v].dist + 1
					enqueue(w, Q);
				}
			}
		}

		dispose_queue(Q);


	}

### 9.3.2 Dijkstra's Algorithm

This algorithm is for weighted graph, which is harder.

_Dijkstra's algorithm_ is a greedy algorithm. It proceeds in stages.

We define: a _stage_ is a particular point in the program where **a list of records** has a list of particular value.

A stage in Dijkstra's algorithm is

* A set S containing {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>};
* A d<sub>v</sub> array such that for each V, d<sub>v</sub> is the shortest path via verices in S as intermediates.

And the initial state is 

* S = {Ã¸};
* d(s) = 0, all other MAX.

Procedure from stage k to k + 1 is

* Find minimum d(v) not in S
* S = S + {v}
* For every element w not in S(note v is in S now), d(w) = min{d(w), d(v) + vw}

In the pseudocode, we assume:

* Vertices are numbered from 0 to NUM_VERTEX

And we provide definition for vertex, table, and a init_table routine.

Pseudocode:

	typedef int vertex;
	struct table_entry
	{
		List header;
		int known;
		dist_type dist;
		vertex path;
	};
	#define NOT_A_VERTEX 0
	typedef struct table_entry Table[NUM_VERTEX + 1];

	void init_table(vertex start, graph G, Table T)
	{
		int i;

		read_graph(G, T);
		for(i = NUM_VERTEX; i > 0; i--)
		{
			T[i].known = FALSE;
			T[i].dist = INT_MAX;
			T[i].path = NOT_A_VERTEX;

		}
		T[start].dist = 0;
	}

	void dijkstra(Table T)
	{
		vertex v, w;
		while (1)
		{
			v = smallest unknown distance vertex;

			if (v == NOT_A_VERTEX)
				break;
			T[v].known = TRUE;
			for each w adjacent to v
				if (!T[w].known)
				{
					if (T[v].dist + c(v, w) < T[w].dist)
					{
						decrease(T[w].dist to T[v].dist + c(v,w));
					}
					T[w].path = v;
				}
		}
	}

We can prove this algorithm always works **as long as no edge has a negative cost.**

Running time:

*|V| finding minimum each phase
*|V| phase
*|E| updating d

Totally O(|E| + |V|^2). If the graph are dense, this is efficient; Otherwise we nee to use a priority queue to keep distances.

Two thing need to be resolved when using priority queue:

* Delete_min to get the minimum, which is O(log |V|)
* How to update d(w) since it's in the queue?

For the second problem, sure we can perform a decrease_key. Note this is slower than the non-priority-queue algorithm. And since we cannot perform _find_ efficiently, we need to maintain the location of each d(i). This is not a typical priority queue.

Total time: O(E log V + V log V) = O(E log V)

An alternative is to add repeated w. In this case we need to:

* Delete_min and check if an unknown value is met
* Enlarge the queue to |E|

In pratical cases, the graphs are typically sparse, so it's important to solve this problem with a priority queue.
